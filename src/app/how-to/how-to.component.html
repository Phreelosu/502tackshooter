                Many pre-built gaming PCs are available, but there's a special feeling when you use one that you put together on your own. Building a computer might seem intimidating at first, even though it's not that hard. If you're taking on your first build or it's been a while, we've created a simple, step-by-step guide to help you build your own PC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we start, just know this guide is all about putting together your computer. So, first things first, choose the parts you need. We've got a list of tested and approved cases, CPUs, GPUs, motherboards, SSDs, power supplies, and RAM to help you decide. Or if you have a specific budget, check out our Best PC Builds page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important thing to remember is that every build is unique. The sequence we're following here is influenced by both personal preference and the requirements of our particular build. For example, if you've got a big aftermarket cooler that extends over the RAM slots, it might make sense to install your memory first. Similarly, if you're putting in an AIO cooler radiator at the top of your case, it's often a good idea to connect any power or fan cables up there before the cooler blocks access to the ports and headers.
            </p>
             <p>
                 Similarly, if you're dealing with a notably compact or tight case, along with a massive high-end graphics card, you might have to change the order of installation. In such cases, the graphics card could obstruct access to numerous ports, slots, and connectors.
             </p>
            <p>
                In short, don't be surprised if you need to backtrack and pull out a part here or there to accommodate the quirks of your particular build. But don't get frustrated, as complications like this are common, even for people who have been regularly building PCs for decades.

                Before you start building a PC, you need to get your workspace ready. Make sure that you have all of your parts and tools at the ready. At the very least, you’ll want:

                Connect Components to the Motherboard
            </h2>  
            <p>
                Some people prefer to mount the motherboard in the case before they do anything else, but it’s generally easier with most builds to connect key components like the CPU, M.2 storage and RAM without leaning over the side of the case.
            </p>
            <h2>The CPU</h2>
            <p>
                Whether you’re going with an Intel- or AMD-based build, the first step is to remove the plastic cover protecting the socket, then release the tension lever on the CPU and (with the most recent AMD and Intel platforms) lift up the metal retaining bracket, so you can drop the processor into the

            </p>
            <!-- Ide majd egy képet kéne szerezni egy processzorról. -->
            <p>
                Note that all recent Intel motherboards, as well as AMD's latest AM5 platform, have the CPU-connecting pins built into the socket, while AMD’s AM4 and earlier platforms have the pins on the bottom of the CPU. For the purposes of this story, this is important mostly because it's a lot easier to damage an older AMD CPU by bending its pins. So if you're installing an AM4 (Ryzen 5000 or older) CPU, be extra careful about how you handle and install it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless of which platform you're building around, there will be an arrow/triangle on one corner of the top of the CPU. This needs to line up with the triangle on the socket or socket cover.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don’t attempt to install a CPU with the arrow facing the wrong direction, or you could damage your chip, your board, or both! Once your CPU and socket are properly aligned, you can (gently) drop the chip in place, and it will settle into the socket under its own weight. If it doesn't, pick up the CPU and reseat it. Don't force the processor into the socket or you'll almost certainly damage something.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've got the CPU settled correctly in the socket (check to see that it sits evenly, so that it isn't sticking up on any one side), drop the retaining bracket down over the edges of the processor, then press the tension lever back down.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that on Intel 12th and 13th Gen boards in particular, this may require a surprising amount of force, to the point that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-comments-on-alder-lakes-warping-and-bending-issues-mods-void-warranty" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-comments-on-alder-lakes-warping-and-bending-issues-mods-void-warranty" data-component-tracked="1" class="hawk-link-parsed"><u>socket bending</u></a> is a known issue, for those who often remove and reinstall processors in their motherboards. This shouldn't be a concern for a regular build where you install the CPU once or perhaps twice. Just know that you'll have to push the retention lever down pretty hard to get it to slip under its retention tab. So long as you've double-checked that your CPU is correctly seated before this, there's no cause for concern.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Note that the above instructions pertain to the mainstream platforms for AMD and Intel. Enthusiast platforms like Intel’s Xeon (or older Core X) and AMD’s Threadripper have different / more complex CPU installations, with the Intel chips involving two levers and Threadripper requiring Torx screws and a slide-in plastic bracket. Given the cost and added complexity, we would not recommend either of these for your first PC build.   
            </p>
            <h2>The Cooler</h2>
            <p>
                Many processors come with coolers in the box. If you’re not doing any heavy overclocking, those may be good enough, though lots of builders also like to buy more powerful (and often quieter) aftermarket coolers, which may also be more visually appealing.
            </p>
            <!-- Ide majd egy képet kéne szerezni egy processzor hűtőről. -->
            <p>
                If you decide to use the stock cooler, you'll find that it already has thermal paste applied, as do many AIOs and aftermarket coolers.
            </p>
            <!-- Hátulja egy processzor hűtőnek. -->
            <p>
                Regardless of whether there is pre-applied paste on your cooler or not, don't forget to peel the protective film off the cold plate / paste area before installing the cooler. If you skip this step, you'll have to tear half of your system apart later when you realize your CPU temperatures are abnormally high.
            </p>
            <p>While pre-applied thermal paste is increasingly common, you’ll still often need to apply your own thermal paste atop the CPU. The tube that comes with your cooler will work well enough, but if you want even lower temperatures, consider checking out our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-thermal-paste" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-thermal-paste" data-component-tracked="1" class="hawk-link-parsed"><u>best thermal paste</u></a> that was tested.</p>
            <!-- Majd egy képet ide egy pasztázott processzorról. -->
            <p>
                You don’t need to apply much thermal paste – a pea-sized amount (about 3 mm) applied to the center of the CPU is recommended for AMD's most recent chips. And a pattern of five smaller dollops is recommended for recent Intel CPUs, which are longer and have their heat-generating components less centrally placed under the heat spreader. Serious overclockers and veteran builders may have their own techniques. Just make sure you don't add too much paste; you don't want it squirting out the sides onto the socket and surrounding PCB.
            </p>
            <!-- Processzor hűtőről egy kép. -->
            <p>
                Stock coolers for Intel processors use push pins that go through holes in the motherboard. We recommend pushing opposite corners in to evenly spread the thermal paste and to keep from putting uneven pressure on one side of the CPU  (just as you should do when screwing down any cooler). AMD stock coolers have metal arms that snap into notches on a plastic bracket on either side of the socket. To mount aftermarket coolers on AMD motherboards, these plastic brackets often need to be removed.
            </p>
            <!-- Utántárgyott hűtő socketek. -->
            <p>
                Aftermarket coolers mount in various, often much more complicated ways. So be sure to consult the instruction manual for your cooler. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You may need to install a large backplate that has to be mounted behind the motherboard, which you should do before installing it in your case. Many cases have cut-out sections behind the motherboard area to allow for adding a CPU mounting plate after the motherboard is installed. But the cutout doesn't always line up with the CPU socket area. And holding a metal plate in place behind the motherboard while you add mounting hardware inside the case requires a lot of dexterity and patience.

                Also note that if you are installing a large air cooler that will hang over your RAM slots (like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&amp;mid=44583&amp;u1=tomshardware-hu-1128744850888818728&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fdeepcool-ak620-wh%2Fp%2FN82E16835856201" data-url="https://www.newegg.com/deepcool-ak620-wh/p/N82E16835856201" target="_blank" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&amp;mid=44583&amp;u1=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fdeepcool-ak620-wh%2Fp%2FN82E16835856201" rel="sponsored noopener" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="newegg.com" data-merchant-id="107327" data-merchant-url="newegg.com" data-merchant-network="LS" data-component-tracked="1" class="hawk-link-parsed" data-custom-tracking-id="1128744850888818728" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-label=" DeepCool AK620"><u> DeepCool AK620</u></a> we used in the build for many of these photos), it's a good idea to do our next step (installing the memory) before installing the cooler. You are reading this before and not while you're building your PC, right?
            </p>
            <!-- CPU Fan connector képek -->
            <p>
                Once the cooler is installed, plug the CPU fan connector into its header on the motherboard. This is usually somewhere close to the CPU socket and labeled something like "CPU_FAN." If you have a larger cooler with two fans, you'll also need to plug in the second fan (usually on a nearby header labeled "CPU_AUX." And if you're installing a liquid AIO cooler, the pump also needs to get plugged in, with many boards offering a "CPU_PUMP" header connector as well.
